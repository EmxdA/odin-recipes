    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      With layer upon layer of rich tomatoey beef mince, pasta, and creamy
      cheesy sauce, it’s hard to find something we dislike about lasagne. We
      mean, there’s a reason why the beloved dish has become a dinner staple in
      households around the world. Taking all the best parts of traditional
      lasagne, we’ve created the finestvariation for you to make from scratch at
      home. The flavourful red sauce made rich with red wine, and the perfectly
      stacked al dente pasta, are just a few of the reasons why this recipe is
      our all-time favourite. But if we were to pick one thing that makes this
      lasagne recipe stand out above all others, it’s the luscious
      cheese-studded bechamel sauce, which pairs perfectly with the slowly
      simmered beef mince and tomato sauce. A good bechamel base takes time -
      but it’s worth it for the extra depth of flavour you won’t find with many
      lasagnes. Top with a generous sprinkling of mozzarella for the ultimate
      cheese-pull, and you’ll be saying ‘bellissimo!’ with every bite.

      <li>1 brown onion, halved, finely chopped</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
      <li>750g Coles beef mince regular</li>
      <li>2 x 400g cans Italian diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>125ml (1/2 cup) dry red wine</li>
      <li>55g (1/4 cup) tomato paste</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>Olive oil, extra, to grease</li>
      <li>4 fresh lasagne sheets</li>
      <li>
        55g (1/2 cup) coarsely grated Devondale Mozzarella Cheese Block (500g)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and
        garlic (2 garlic cloves, crushed) and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or
        until onion softens. Add the mince and cook, stirring with a wooden
        spoon to break up any lumps, for 5 minutes or until mince changes
        colour. Add the tomato, wine and tomato paste, and bring to the boil.
        Reduce heat to low. Simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 30
        minutes or until sauce thickens slightly. Remove from heat. Taste and
        season with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, to make the cheese sauce, combine the milk, onion, parsley
        stalks, peppercorns, cloves and bay leaves in a medium saucepan and
        bring to a simmer over medium heat. Remove from heat and set aside for
        15 minutes to infuse.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain the milk mixture through a fine sieve into a large jug. Discard
        solids.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt the butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until foaming.
        Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 1-2 minutes or until mixture
        bubbles and begins to come away from the side of the pan. Remove from
        heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Gradually pour in half the milk, whisking constantly with a balloon
        whisk, until mixture is smooth. Gradually add the remaining milk,
        whisking until smooth and combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to the boil, stirring
        constantly with a wooden spoon, for 5 minutes or until sauce thickens
        and coats the back of the spoon. Remove from heat. Add the parmesan and
        stir until cheese melts. Taste and season with nutmeg, salt and white
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 180°C. Brush a rectangular 3L (12 cup) capacity
        ovenproof dish with oil to lightly grease. Spread one-quarter of the
        bechamel sauce over the base of the prepared dish. Arrange 1 lasagne
        sheet over the sauce. Top with one-third of the mince mixture and
        one-third of the remaining bechamel sauce. Continue layering with the
        remaining lasagne sheets, mince mixture and bechamel, finishing with a
        layer of bechamel. Sprinkle with mozzarella. Place on a baking tray.
        Bake in preheated oven for 40 minutes or until cheese melts, is golden
        brown, and the edges are bubbling. Remove from oven and set aside for 10
        minutes to set.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the lasagne into 8 portions and serve with mixed salad leaves.
